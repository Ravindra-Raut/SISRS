# *SISRS* v2.0 SNP Identification from Short Read Sequences


*SISRS* — pronounced “scissors” — is a program for identifying phylogenetically informative sites from next-generation whole-genome sequencing of multiple species. It identifies homologous sites without the need to do de novo assembly, annotation, and alignment. It identifies conserved regions by doing joint de novo assembly on multiple species. Sequencing reads are then aligned back to the contigs to identify variable sites.

## Website

To learn how to use our software, and what software dependencies it has, we ask you to look at [SISRS Docs](https://schwartzlaburi.github.io/SISRS/).

## Support and Communication

If you have any questions about the software, please feel free to reach out to us on our github issues page @ [SISRS Github](https://github.com/SchwartzLabURI/SISRS/issues).

For other forms of communication we invite you to go to our lab's personal website @ [Schwartz Lab](https://schwartzlaburi.github.io/index.html).
